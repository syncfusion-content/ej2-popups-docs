# Getting started in ##Platform_Name## Predefined dialogs control

This section explains how to create a simple redefined dialogs, and configure its available functionalities in TypeScript using Essential JS 2 [quickstart](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-quickstart-webpack-) seed repository.

> This application is integrated with the `webpack.config.js` configuration and uses the latest version of the [webpack-cli](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/#commands). It requires node `v14.15.0` or higher. For more information about webpack and its features, refer to the [webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/).

## Dependencies

The following list of dependencies are required to use Predefined dialogs in your application.

```javascript

|-- @syncfusion/ej2-popups
    |-- @syncfusion/ej2-base
    |-- @syncfusion/ej2-buttons

```

## Set up development environment

Open the command prompt from the required directory, and run the following command to clone the Syncfusion JavaScript (Essential JS 2) quickstart project from [GitHub](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-quickstart-webpack-).

```
    git clone https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-quickstart-webpack- ej2-quickstart
```

After cloning the application in the `ej2-quickstart` folder, run the following command line to navigate to the `ej2-quickstart` folder.

```
    cd ej2-quickstart
```

## Add Syncfusion JavaScript packages

Syncfusion JavaScript (Essential JS 2) packages are available on the [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/~syncfusionorg) public registry. You can install all Syncfusion JavaScript (Essential JS 2) controls in a single [@syncfusion/ej2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/ej2) package or individual packages for each control.

The quickstart application is preconfigured with the dependent [@syncfusion/ej2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/ej2) package in the `~/package.json` file. Use the following command to install the dependent npm packages from the command prompt.

```
    npm install
```

## Import the Syncfusion CSS styles

Syncfusion JavaScript controls come with [built-in themes](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/theme/), which are available in the installed packages. It's easy to adapt the Syncfusion JavaScript controls to match the style of your application by referring to one of the built-in themes.

The quickstart application is preconfigured to use the `Material` theme in the `~/src/styles/styles.css` file, as shown below: 

```
  @import "../../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2/material.css";
```

> You can check out the [themes](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/theme/) section to know more about built-in themes and CSS reference for individual controls.
